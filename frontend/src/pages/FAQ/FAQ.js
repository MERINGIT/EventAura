            "answer": "For organizers we recommend using our services at least 2 weeks in advance. This allows us to secure the best resources and provide you with the support you need for a successful event. If you're planning a large-scale event or have specific requirements, booking earlier will help ensure everything goes smoothly. For attendees to secure your spot at an event, it's best to book your tickets as soon as possible. Popular events can sell out quickly, so booking early guarantees you a place and often provides better options for seating and pricing."
